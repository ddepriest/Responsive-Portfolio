			<h1>About Me</h1>

			class="auth-image" alt="Pitching">

			<p>Born and raised in Miami and Homestead, Florida.  Survived Hurricane Andrew 25+ years ago.  Enrolled at UNC-Chapel Hill on a football scholarship in the fall of 1995.  Walked-on the UNC Baseball team, and became one of the top relief pitchers in college baseball.  Graduated in May 2000 with a B.A. in Excercise & Sport Science. Drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 17th round of the 2000 MLB Draft.  Played professionally and coached pro and college baseball from 2000-2009.
			</p>
			
			<p>Started my traditional professional career in Nov. 2009 as a Financial Consultant with Charles Schwab in Chapel Hill, NC.  Transitioned into Risk Management and Health Benefits Underwriting in April 2013 with Scott Insurance in Raleigh, NC.  I am now seeking my next challenge, and I have determined that whatever that challenge may be, coding will allow me to maximize my value to a company or a new business venture of my own.</p>
